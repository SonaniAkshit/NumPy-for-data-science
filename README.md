# NumPy for Data Science

This repository documents my **focused learning of NumPy**, built specifically for a **data science career**.

The goal is not to cover every NumPy feature, but to **master the core numerical concepts** that are actually used in:

* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Machine learning foundations
* Performance-oriented numerical computing

This repository is designed to build a **strong mental model of arrays, shapes, and vectorized operations**, which makes learning Pandas and machine learning significantly easier.



## 🎯 Repository Goal

To become **comfortable and confident with NumPy** as the numerical backbone of data science.

By the end of this repository, I aim to:

* Think in terms of **arrays instead of loops**
* Understand **rows, columns, shapes, and axes clearly**
* Write **clean and efficient numerical code**
* Prepare a solid foundation for **Pandas, ML, and DL**



## 📌 What This Repository Covers

Only **essential NumPy topics** required for real data science work:

* NumPy arrays and fundamentals
* Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
* Creating arrays and understanding their structure
* Shape, dimension, size, and datatype
* Indexing, slicing, and data selection
* Boolean masking and filtering
* Vectorized mathematical operations
* Aggregations and basic statistics
* Axis-based computations
* Reshaping and broadcasting
* Random number generation
* Handling missing values
* Practical linear algebra for ML
* Performance basics and vectorization
* Smooth transition from NumPy to Pandas

Anything outside this scope is intentionally excluded to avoid overload.

<!-- ## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic follows the same simple structure:

```
topic_name/
│
├── notes.ipynb              # Concept explanations + small examples
├── practice_questions.md    # Easy → hard practice problems
└── practice.ipynb           # Solved exercises and experiments
```

This structure supports **learning, practice, and revision**. -->



## 🧠 Learning Approach

* One topic at a time
* No rushing
* Concepts before shortcuts
* Practice after every topic
* Focus on understanding, not memorization



## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git & GitHub



## ⚠️ Notes

* This is a **learning repository**, not a finished product
* Code and notes may be refined as understanding improves
* The emphasis is on **clarity and correctness**
* Depth is prioritized over speed
